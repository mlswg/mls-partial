--- abstract

The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides efficient asynchronous
group key establishment for large groups with up to thousands of clients. In
MLS, any member can commit a change to the group, and consequently, all members
must download, validate, and maintain the full group state, which can incur a
significant communication and computational costs, especially when joining a
group. This document defines an MLS extension to support "partial MLS clients" that don't
undertake these costs. A partial client cannot commit changes to the group, and
only has partial authentication information for the other members of the group,
but is otherwise able to participate in the group. In exchange for these
limitations, a partial MLS client can participate in an MLS group with significantly
lower requirements in terms of download, memory, and processing.

# Introduction

The Messaging Layer Security protocol {{!RFC9420}} enables continuous group
authenticated key exchange among a group of clients. The design of MLS requires
all members to download, validate, and maintain the full MLS tree, including
validating the credentials and signatures of all members. The size of the MLS
tree is linear in the size of the group. Consequently, the MLS design results in
a performance bottleneck for new members seeking to join a large group, and
significant storage and memory requirements once the member has joined.

This document defines an extension to MLS to allow for "partial clients" --
clients that do not download, validate, or maintain the entire ratchet tree for
the group. On the one hand, this property allows a partial client to
participate in the group with much significantly lower communication and
computation complexity. On the other hand, without the full ratchet tree, the
partial client cannot create Commit messages to put changes to the group into
effect. Partial clients also only have authentication information for the parts
of the tree they download, not the whole group.

This document does not change the core logic of MLS, including: The structure of
the ratchet tree and its associated algorithms, the key schedule, the secret
tree, and application message protection. The messages sent and received by
normal clients in the course of an MLS session are likewise unchanged. With
proper modifications to the MLS Delivery Service, standard MLS clients can
participate in a group with partial clients without any modification.

The only modifications this document makes are to the local state stored at
partial clients, namely the component of MLS that manages, synchronizes, and
authenticates the public group state. We also defines some "annotations" that
need to be appended to group messages so that they can be processed by partial
clients. Partial clients effectively run normal MLS algorithms, but with
just-in-time delivery of exactly the subset of the public group state needed by
a given algorithm. We achieve this property due to the fact that aside from initial
tree validation and sending commits, a client only needs log-scale information.

In summary, Partial MLS allows partial clients to obtain greater efficiency, at the
cost of lowering the authentication guarantees they receive and losing the
ability to make Commits.  We discuss a few scenarios that motivate this
trade-off in {{use-cases}}.  The difference in authentication properties, in
particular, is discussed in detail in {{security-considerations}}.

# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Tree slice:
: A tree slice is the direct path from a leaf node to the root, together with
the tree hashes on the co-path.

Membership proof:
: A tree slice that proves that a given leaf node is part of a ratchet tree with
a given tree hash.

Partial client:
: An MLS client that does not download, validate, and maintain a copy of the
group's ratchet tree. A partial client does not store any public data about the
group's ratchet tree, only the HPKE decryption keys associated to nodes on the
client's direct path.

Full client:
: A normal MLS client, in possession of the full MLS ratchet tree for the group.

Sender-authenticated message:
: A signed MLS message such as Welcome or PublicMessage, together with a
membership proof that proves the sender's membership in the group.

Annotated Welcome:
: A Welcome message together with information that a partial client needs to
process it.

Annotated Commit:
: A Commit message (as a PublicMessage or PrivateMessage) together with
information that a partial client needs to process it.

As in MLS, message structures are defined using the TLS presentation syntax
{{!RFC8446}}. Unlike most MLS messages, however, these structures are not
encapsulated in a signed or MAC'ed structure. So it may be more convenient for
applications to encode these structures in application-specific encodings.

# Use Cases

Partial MLS is intended to support use cases where MLS groups are very large, from
thousands to millions of participants.  Application-level constraints arising
from these use cases align well with the trade-offs introduced by Partial MLS.  It
is usually acceptable (even desirable) that only certain members are able to
send Commit messages.  And in such large groups, clients often do not care about
authenticating all members of the group.

The following subsections outline two concrete use cases.

## Large Meetings / Webinars

MLS can be used to establish end-to-end encryption keys in real-time
conferencing scenarios.  In such scenarios, a client joins the MLS group when
they are admitted to a meeting.  With normal MLS, the client is required to
download and validate the entire ratchet tree before being able to derive media
encryption keys.  In meetings with a thousand or more participants, this process
can take enough time that it introduces a noticeable delay in joining the
meeting.  If a client joins as a partial client, then they can download a
log-sized AnnotatedWelcome message and immediately obtain the media encryption
keys.

Such a client will not have authenticated the group when they join the meeting.
However, applications often do not display identity information in such setting
anyway.  In "webinar" settings, it is common for attendee identities to be visible
only to panelists and administrators, not to other attendees.  Partial MLS allows
MLS to align with this privacy property.  If attendees join as partial clients,
they can be provided with membership proofs for attendees whom they are
authorized to see, and not for others.  Even in settings where attendees can all
see each others' identities, user interface constraints usually cause only a
small fraction of the attendee list to be visible at one time, so it is natural
to load the tree dynamically as the client needs access to the authenticated
identities of specific other clients.

The constraint on clients sending Commits is also natural here.  In such large
gatherings, there are usually administrators who are authorized to see the
identities of all participants and control who is in the group, and conversely,
there are certain actions that are not available to non-admin participants.  So
it makes sense for the administrators to use full clients that are able to make
Commits to implement the actions they are authorized to take, and for more
limited clients to be unable to make commits.

## Broadcast sessions

Internet streaming platforms frequently host broadcasts with large numbers of
viewers, but the entities providing these broadcasts might like to ensure that
the streaming platform cannot see the streamed content.  For example, the Media
over QUIC Transport protocol, designed to support streaming use cases, states as
a goal ensuring that "the media content itself remains opaque and private" from
the relays involved in its distribution {{?I-D.ietf-moq-transport}}.

In such settings, the partial client / full client roles align with the viewer /
owner roles, respectively.  Viewers do not care about the identities of other
viewers (at most, they care that the stream comes from an authentic source) and
they aren't authorized to do anything in MLS besides join the group.  Viewers
are also typically in more constrained situations than the source of a stream.
So the reduced resource requirements are well worth the loss of full-group
authentication and the ability to Commit.

# Protocol Overview

A partial client does not receive or validate a full copy of the ratchet tree for
a group, but still possesses the group's secrets, including receiving updated
secrets as the group evolves. When MLS messages are sent to a partial client,
they need to be accompanied by annotations that provide the partial client with
just enough of information about the ratchet tree to process the message. These
annotations can be computed by any party with knowledge of the group's ratchet
tree, including the committer and sometimes the DS.

{: #fig-overview title="Overview of Partial MLS" }

{{fig-overview}} illustrates the main changes introduced by Partial MLS:

1. When a partial client is added to the group, they are provided an
   AnnotatedWelcome message, which comprises a normal Welcome message plus
   membership proofs for the sender and joiner.

2. From each Commit that is generated in the group, an individual
   AnnotatedCommit is generated for each partial client. An AnntatedCommit
   comprises a normal MLS Commit message, together with membership proofs and
   the information that the partial client needs in order to process the update
   path in the Commit.

3. When messages are sent in the group, e.g., carrying application data,
   they are extended with a membership proofs so that partial clients can
   authenticate the sender's membership in the group.

In this example, we have shown the required annotations being added by the DS.
This allows full clients to behave as they would in normal MLS, but requires
that the DS maintain a copy of the group's ratchet tree. It is also possible
for committers to generate the required annotated messages. This document does
not define who generates annotated messages from the base MLS messages, or how
this entity learns which clients are partial or full clients.

Partial clients still need to be provided with access to any proposals sent in a
group outside of Commits. Partial clients cannot process proposals that modify the
structure of the tree, in particular Add, Update, or Remove proposals. They
can, however, verify that these proposals were included in a given Commit. And
they need to see proposals such as PreSharedKey or GroupContextExtensions so
that they can update their state appropriately.

Depending on how Partial MLS is deployed, a client might need to inform the DS or
other members of its status (partial or full), so that the proper annotations can
be generated when it is partial. It is harmless for a full client to receive an
AnnotatedCommit; the annotations can simply be ignored.

# Upgrading and Downgrading

A partial client can upgrade to being a full client at any time by downloading the
full ratchet tree; a full client can downgrade by deleting its local copy of the
ratchet tree.  Before a partial client uses a copy of the ratchet tree to upgrade
to being a full client, it MUST verify the integrity of the ratchet tree in the
same way it would when joining as a full client, following the steps in
{{Section 12.4.3.1 of RFC9420}}.

# Membership Proofs and Partial Trees

Although partial clients do not have a copy of the group's ratchet tree, they
still agree on the root tree hash of the ratchet tree, via the MLS key schedule
as usual. This fact, together with the Merkle-tree-like structure of the MLS
tree hash, allows a partial client to verify the legitimacy of partial information
about the ratchet tree. In particular, for any leaf in the tree, anyone in
possession of the public data of the ratchet tree can construct a "membership
proof" that proves that a leaf node with specific contents is located at a
specific leaf index in the tree.

A membership proof for a leaf node comprises:

* The number of leaves in the tree.

* The leaf index of the member's leaf.

* The values of the nodes from the leaf node to the root of the tree, including
  both the leaf node and the root.

* The tree hash values for the nodes on the copath of the leaf node.

~~~
struct {
    opaque hash_value<V>;
} CopathHash;

struct {
  uint32 leaf_index;
  uint32 n_leaves;
  optional<Node> direct_path_nodes<V>;
  CopathHash copath_hashes<V>;
} MembershipProof;
~~~

From these values, the root tree hash of the ratchet tree can be recomputed,
following the same recursive algorithm specified in {{Section 7.8 of RFC9420}}.
The selection of nodes and subtree hashes provides the precise collection of
inputs required by the algorithm.

A membership proof is said to be valid relative to a given tree hash if the tree
hash recomputed in this way is equal to the given tree hash.

Two membership proofs are said to reference the same tree if their `n_leaves`
fields are equal, and they produce identical root tree hashes.

# Sender-Authenticated Messages

For several types of message, MLS authenticates that a message was created by
the member at a specific leaf node of the group's ratchet tree by signing the
message with the private key corresponding to the `signature_key` in the leaf
node. Full clients verify these messages by looking up the required signature
verification key in their local copy of the ratchet tree.

Since partial clients do not store the group's ratchet tree, they cannot perform
this lookup. A SenderAuthenticatedMessage presents a message along with a
membership proof for the sender of a message, which provides the required leaf
node and a proof of its inclusion in the tree.

~~~ tls-syntax
struct {
    T message;
    MembershipProof sender_membership_proof;
} SenderAuthenticatedMessage<T>;
~~~

Before using the `sender_membership_proof` to verify the included message, a client
processing a SenderAuthenticatedMessage MUST verify that the proof is valid
relative to the group's tree hash for the epoch in which the message was sent.
For a PublicMessage or PrivateMessage, this is the tree hash for the epoch
indicated in the FramedContent. For a GroupInfo or Welcome, it is the tree hash
in the object itself.

# Joining via Annotated Welcome

An AnnotatedWelcome message provides a client joining a group with membership
proofs for the sender and the joiner (i.e., the recipient of the message).

~~~ tls-syntax
struct {
    SenderAuthenticatedMessage<Welcome> welcome;
    MembershipProof joiner_membership_proof;
} AnnotatedWelcome;
~~~

The fields in the AnnotatedWelcome have the following semantics:

`welcome`:
: A Welcome message, together with a membership proof for the sender relative to
the ratchet tree specified in the Welcome.

`joiner_membership_proof`:
: A proof of the receipient's membership in the ratchet tree specified in the
Welcome.

An AnnotatedWelcome can be generated by any party that knows the group's ratchet
tree and the indices of the sender and joiner in the tree.

A partial client processes an AnnotatedWelcome in the following way:

1. Verify that the `sender_membership_proof` and `joiner_membership_proof`
   reference the same tree.

2. Join the group using the procedure defined in {{Section 12.4.3.1 of
   RFC9420}}, with the following modifications:

   * When verifying the signature on the GroupInfo object, the signature public
     key is taken from the LeafNode in the `sender_membership_proof` tree slice.
     The `signer` field of the `group_info` object MUST be equal to the
     `leaf_index` field of the `sender_membership_proof`.

   * The "Verify the integrity of the ratchet tree" step is replaced with a
     check that the `tree_hash` in the GroupInfo matches the root tree hash
     produced by the membership proofs.

   * The `my_leaf` value is taken from the the `leaf_index` field of the
     `joiner_membership_proof`, instead of found by searching the tree.

# Joining via External Commit

A partial client cannot join via an external Commit, because partial clients cannot
generate commits. A client could, however, join as a full client via an
external commit, then transition to being a partial client by deleting its copy of
the tree. This would still require the client to download and validate the
tree, but would save the client the effort of maintaining their copy of the
tree.

# Annotated Commit

There are two main challenges for a partial client processing a Commit. First,
the partial client cannot compute the resolution of the committer's copath, so
they cannot determine which of the HPKECiphertext objects in the UpdatePath they
should decrypt to obtain a path secret. Second, the partial client cannot compute
the updated tree hash, since they don't have the full tree. An AnnotatedCommit
provides these pieces of information, along with proof that the sender and
receiver are both still in the group after the Commit.

~~~ tls-syntax
struct {
    MLSMessage commit;
    optional<MembershipProof> sender_membership_proof;

    opaque tree_hash_after<V>;
    optional<uint32> resolution_index;

    MembershipProof sender_membership_proof_after;
    MembershipProof receiver_membership_proof_after;
} AnnotatedCommit;
~~~

The fields in the AnnotatedCommit have the following semantics:

`commit`:
: An MLSMessage containing PrivateMessage or PublicMessage with `content_type`
`commit`.

`sender_membership_proof`:
: A membership proof for the sender of the Commit relative to the tree for the
epoch in which the Commit is sent. This field MUST be present if the
`sender_type` for the Commit is `member`, and otherwise MUST be absent.

`tree_hash_after`:
: The tree hash of the group's ratchet tree after the Commit has been applied.

`resolution_index`:
: The recipient can compute which entry in the UpdatePath in the Commit it
should use based on the sender index in the Commit. This index specifies which
HPKECiphertext in the UpdatePathNode to use. This field MUST be included if and
only if the Commit has a `path` field populated.

`sender_membership_proof_after`:
: A membership proof for the sender of the Commit relative to the tree after the
Commit has been applied.

`receiver_membership_proof_after`:
: A membership proof for the receiver of the Commit relative to the tree after the
Commit has been applied.

An AnnotatedCommit can be generated by any party that knows the group's ratchet
tree (both before and after the Commit) and the indices of the sender and joiner
in the tree. It is safe for the recipient to accept the `tree_hash` supplied by
an unauthenticated party because the tree hash is authenticated by the
`confirmation_tag` in the Commit.

A partial client processes an AnnotatedCommit in the following way:

1. Verify that the `sender_membership_proof` in the `commit` field, if present,
   is valid relative to the group's current tree hash.

2. Verify that the `sender_membership_proof_after` and
   `receiver_membership_proof_after` reference the same tree, and that they are
   valid relative to `tree_hash_after`.

3. Process the Commit using the procedure defined in {{Section 12.4.2 of
   RFC9420}}, with the following modifications:

  * When validating a FramedContent with `sender_type` set to `member`, the
    `sender_membership_proof` field MUST be present, and the signature public
    key is taken from the LeafNode in the `sender_membership_proof` tree slice.
    The `leaf_index` field of the `Sender` object MUST be equal to the
    `leaf_index` field of the `sender_membership_proof`.

    * If the `sender_type` is set to `new_member_commit` (the only other valid
      value), then the signature public key is looked up in the included Add
      proposal, as normal. In this case, there is no further validation of the
      `leaf_index` field of of the `sender_membership_proof`.

  * The proposal list validation step is omitted, because a partial client doesn't
    have sufficient information to check all of the validation rules.

  * When applying proposals, only the proposals that do not modify the tree are
    applied, in particular, PreSharedKey and GroupContextExtensions proposals.

  * Likewise, the creation of the new ratchet tree is omitted.

  * In processing the `path` value, if present, replace the path node decryption
    steps with the following steps:

    * Use the `leaf_index` field of the `sender_membership_proof` to identify
      the lowest common ancestor between the committer. This is the node where
      the new path_secret will be inserted into the tree.

    * Determine the index `update_path_index` of the lowest common ancestor
      among the non-blank nodes in the committer's direct path, as provided in
      the `sender_membership_proof_after` field.

    * From the entry at index `update_path_index` of the `nodes` vector in the
      UpdatePath, select the HPKECiphertext at index `resolution_index` from the
      `encrypted_path_secret`.

    * Identify the next non-blank node in the recipient's direct path under the
      lowest common ancestor, using the direct path provided in the
      `recipient_membership_proof_after` field. Retrieve the private HPKE
      decryption key for this node.

    * Decrypt the encrypted path secret as normal, using the tree hash in the
      `tree_hash_after` field in the provisional GroupContext.

    * Derive the remaining path secrets corresponding to the non-blank nodes in
      the recipient's new direct path, as provided in the
      `recipient_membership_proof_after` field.

    * Define the `commit_secret` to be `path_secret[n+1]`, as normal.

# Application Messages

MLS clients can exchange messages by sending application data within the
PrivateMessage framing. In a group where partial clients are present, these
messages should be further encapsulated in a SenderAuthenticatedMessage, so that
partial clients have the membership proof necessary to verify the sender's
membership, the public key necessary to verify the message signature, and the
credential necessary to verify the sender's identity.

As noted above, this can be accomplished either by the sender creating a
SenderAuthenticatedMessage, or by the DS adding the relevant membership proof
while the message is in transit.

Note that encapsulating a message as a SenderAuthenticatedMessage leaks
information about the sender to the DS, including the sender's index in the tree
and the sender's LeafNode.  See {{metadata-privacy}} for more discussion of
metadata privacy.

# Operational Considerations

The major operational challenge in deploying Partial MLS is ensuring that partial
clients receive the proper annotations to Welcome and Commit messages. As
discussed in {{protocol-overview}}, this is up to the application. Since full
clients don't need the annotations, applications will be more robust if they
send annotations in a way that they can be cleanly ignored by full clients.

Partial MLS substantially reduces the amount of data required to join an MLS
group, since it replaces the linear-scale ratchet tree with two log-scale
membership proofs. Partial MLS does not address the potentially linear scaling of
Commit messages; in fact, it makes Commits spartially bigger. There are other
approaches to reducing Commit sizes, e.g., the SplitCommit approach in
{{?I-D.mularczyk-mls-splitmls}}.  These approaches can be cleanly integrated
with Partial MLS via the AnnotatedCommit structure.  {{download-cost}} summarizes
the scaling of the amount of data that a client needs to download in order to
perform various MLS operations.  Sending a Commit requires linear-scale work in
any case.

| Operation       | RFC MLS | Partial MLS | Split Commits | Partial + Split |
|:----------------|:-------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
| Join            |  O(N)   | O(log N)    | O(N)          | O(log N)        |

# Security Considerations

The MLS protocol in {{!RFC9420}} has a number of security analyses attached. To
describe the security of Partial MLS and how it relates to the security of full
MLS we summarize the following main high-level guarantees of MLS as follows:

- **Membership Agreement**: If a client B has a local group state for group G in
  epoch N, and it receives (and accepts) an application message from a sender A
  for group G in epoch N, then A must be a member of G in epoch N at B, and if A
  is honest, then A and B agree on the full membership of the group G in
  epoch N.

- **Member Identity Authentication**: If a client B has a local group state for
  group G in epoch N, and B believes that A is a member of G in epoch N, and
  that A is linked to a user identity U, then either the signature key of Uâs
  credential is compromised, or A belongs to U.

- **Group Key Secrecy**: If B has a local group state for group G in epoch N
  with group key K (init secret), then K can only be known to members of G in
  epoch N. That is, if the attacker knows K, then one of the signature or
  decryption keys corresponding to one of the leaves of the tree stored at B for
  G in epoch N must be compromised. To obtain these properties, each member in
  MLS verifies a number of signatures and MACs, and seeks to preserve the
  TreeKEM Tree Invariants:

- **Public Key Tree Invariant**: At each node of the tree at a member B, the
  public key, if set, was set by one of the members currently underneath that
  node

- **Path Secret Invariant**: At each node, the path secret stored at a member B,
  if set, was created by one of the members currently underneath that node

As a corollary of Group Key Secrecy, we also obtain authentication and
confidentiality guarantees for application messages sent and received within a
group.

To verify the security guarantees provided to partial clients, a new security
analysis was needed. We have analyzed the security of the protocol using two
verification tools ProVerif and F*. The security analysis, and design of the
security mechanisms, are inspired by work from Alwen et al.
{{?AHKM22=DOI.10.1145/3548606.3560632}}.

Partial MLS preserves the invariants above and thereby all the security goals of
MLS continue to hold at full members. However, a partial member may not know the
identities of all other members in the group, and it may only discover these
identities on-demand. Consequently, the Member Identity Authentication
guarantee is weaker on partial clients. Furthermore, since partial members do not
store the MLS tree, membership agreement only holds for the hash of the MLS
tree:

- **Partial Membership Agreement**: If a partial client B has a local group state
  for group G in epoch N, and it receives (and accepts) an application message
  from a sender A for group G in epoch N, then A must be a member of G in
  epoch N at B, and if A is honest, then A and B agree on the GroupContext
  of the group G in epoch N.

- **Partial Member Identity Authentication**: If a partial client B has a local
  group state for group G in epoch N, and B has verified Aâs membership proof in
  G, and A is linked to a user identity U, then either the signature key of Uâs
  credential is compromised, or A belongs to U.

- **Partial Group Key Secrecy**: If a partial client B has a local group state for
  group G in epoch N with group key K (init secret), and if the tree hash at B
  corresponds to a full tree, then K can only be known to members at the leaves
  of this tree. That is, if the attacker knows K, then the signature or
  decryption keys at one of the leaves must have been compromised.

Note that the Partial Membership Agreement property holds irrespective of whether
B has verified a membership proof from A.  The membership proofs in this
protocol are thus more about providing precise source authentication within the
group, rather than simply proving membership in the group.  Simply knowing the
group's symmetric secrets suffices for the latter.

Another technical caveat is that since partial members do not have the full tree,
they cannot validate the uniqueness of all HPKE and signature keys in the tree,
as required by RFC MLS. The exact security implications of removing this
uniqueness check is not clear but is not expected to be significant.  In a group
where full clients are honest, there is no practical difference, since a full
client will verify that all of the required uniqness properties hold before
issuing a Commit.  The main risk is that a malicious full client could cause a
partial client to accept a tree hash representing a tree with duplicate keys.

## Metadata Privacy

The protocol described in this document assumes that the DS is trusted to know
information about the group's ratchet tree.  The scenario described in
{{protocol-overview}} assumes that the DS is maintaining a view of the ratchet
tree and distributing appropriate portions of it to clients.  In fact, if the DS
is to generate membership proofs to accompany PrivateMessage messages, then it
will need to know the index of the sender in the tree, information that is
normally encrypted as part of the SenderData.

It is possible to operate this protocol in a more restrictive mode, where
Commits are sent as PrivateMessage objects and the committer generates the
required annotations for any partial clients in the group.  However, because there
is no confidentiality protection for the annotations, they will leak information
to the DS about the ratchet tree.

Fixing this leakage would require changes to logic at the committer and partial
clients.  The annotations attached to a Welcome message could be sent as
GroupInfo extensions; effectively a partial version of the `ratchet_tree`
extension.  The annotations attached to a Commit could be moved inside the
PrivateMessage content, and the receiver signature validation logic updated to
use the public key in the attached membership proof to validate the message
signature.

Thus, while a more metadata-private mode could be added to this protocol, it has
been omitted for now in the interest of avoiding changes to full endpoints.

# Known Issues

* To realize the completely optimized performance profile discussed on
  {{operational-considerations}}, we should define a version of AnnotatedCommit
  that sends a SplitCommit instead of a normal Commit.

* There is no signaling within the group of whether any members are partial
  clients, and if so which ones. This was omitted because it didn't seem
  clearly necessary, but it could be useful. For example, if a client could
  include a LeafNode extension that declares that it is a partial client, then a
  committer could use this signal to proactively generate AnnotatedCommits for
  the members. An approach like this might be necessary if we wanted to enable
  cases where annotations were confidential to the group.

* There are no WireFormat values registered for the new messages defined here
  that are likely to be sent on the wire: AnnotatedCommit,
  AnnotatedWelcome, or SenderAuthenticatedMessage\<PrivateMessage\>. It's not
  clear that these WireFormat values would be needed or useful, though, since
  the annotations added in these messages are effectively outside the bounds of
  MLS. They're more like how the delivery of the ratchet tree is unspecified in
  RFC MLS.
